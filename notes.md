NOTE: on the geometry ones that involve an answer, make the answer be in terms of PI
ALSO: Provide formula for that problem.

Make problems either in order of topic list or remove topic headers entirely

In TESTCONTAINER, add a check for each question to tell if the solution is valid (add a flag in the templatesolver for things like linear equations, to have it check)
    If the solution is invalid (x or y is negative, infinite, or NAN, redo until its good).

FOR SEQUENCES: Scale changes on each field, fix.


For righttriangles (TRIG), need to add a way to keep the angle the same in the answer choices as the randomly generated one. So add a system to add extra data for each method/solver. 


Convert Quadratic solver to work backwards, generating the length and width as integers, giving the user the distance between and then calculate the area.
